AngularJS Guidelines - ZenLabs
=================

These guidelines are written primarily for the Zenlabs team but the developers wanted to share with you how they work.

Don't take anything that's written here to face value, take a global view and be smart vis-Ã -vis your development issues.

We don't provide a unique solution, just enough to put some order in your project.

We're a french team, so in a first phase, we write these guidelines in French (but we'll translate these later). Sorry about that :)
